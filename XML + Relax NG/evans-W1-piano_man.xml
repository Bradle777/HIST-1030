<song><v1>It's <time>nine o'clock on a Saturday</time>   <!--v=verse-->
The <people type="frequent">regular crowd</people> shuffles in
There's an <people type="frequent" person="old_man">old man</people> sittin' next to me
<metaphor meaning="chugging">Makin' love</metaphor> to his <alcohol>tonic and gin</alcohol> <!--I alcohol as a markup throughout just to point out its toxicity on the regulars lives-->
He says, <quote person="old_man">"<singer>Son</singer>, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
<description time="long_ago">When I wore a younger man's clothes</description>"</quote></v1>
<refrain>La, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum</refrain>
<chorus>Sing <people type="frequent">us</people> a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, <people type="frequent">we</people>'re all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' <metaphor meaning="distracted">alright</metaphor></chorus>
<v2>Now <people type="frequent" person="john">John</people> at the <bar>bar</bar> is a friend of mine <!--I added a bar element to bar to highlight the location as a place of destitution and in this verse bar is a subsitute for alcohol-->
He gets me my <alcohol>drinks</alcohol> for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's some place that he'd rather be
He says, <quote person="John">"<singer>Bill</singer>, I believe <pronoun reference="alcohol">this</pronoun> is killing me"</quote>
As the <personification>smile ran away</personification> from his face
<quote person="John">"Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of <pronoun reference="bar">this</pronoun> place"</quote></v2>
<refrain>Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum</refrain>
<v3>Now <people type="frequent" person="Paul">Paul</people> is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with <people type="frequent">Davy</people>, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life
And the <people type="frequent">waitress</people> is practicing politics
As the <people type="frequent">businessmen</people> slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a <metaphor meaning="alcohol">drink they call loneliness</metaphor>
But it's better than drinkin' alone</v3>

<chorus>Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright</chorus>
<v4>It's a pretty good crowd for a <time>Saturday</time>
And the <people type="frequent">manager</people> gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's <singer skill="entertainmnet+distraction">me</singer> they've been comin' to see
To forget about <hardship>life</hardship> for a while <!--The markup makes clear that he is referencing the difficulties they face in life-->
And the <description>piano, it sounds like a carnival</description>
And the <description>microphone smells like a beer</description>
And they sit at the <bar>bar</bar> and put <metaphor meaning="money">bread</metaphor> in my jar
And say, <quote person="patrons">"Man, what are you doin' here?"</quote></v4>
<refrain>Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum</refrain>
    <!--reference the first chrous for markup-->
<chrous>Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright</chrous></song>

<!--In a song it is important to make distinctions between verses and chorus, so I added those elements throughout for more organization-->
