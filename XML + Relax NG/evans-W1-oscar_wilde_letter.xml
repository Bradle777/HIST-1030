    <place>Savoy Hotel</place> Dearest of All Boys, Your letter was delightful, red and yellow wine
    to me; but I am <emotion>sad and out of sorts</emotion>. <person>Bosie</person>, you must not
    make scenes with me. They <hyperbole>kill me</hyperbole>, they wreck the loveliness of life. I
    cannot see you, so Greek and gracious, distorted with passion. I cannot listen to your curved
    lips saying hideous things to me. I would sooner be blackmailed by every renter ["renter"was a
    slang term for male prostitutes] in London than to have you <emotions>bitter, unjust,
        hating</emotions>. You are the divine thing I want, the thing of grace and beauty; but I
    don't know how to do it. Shall I come to <place>Salisbury</place>? My bill here is <rate>49
        pounds for a week</rate>. I have also got a new sitting-room over the <place>Thames</place>.
    Why are you not here, my dear, my wonderful boy? I fear I must leave; no money, no credit, and a
    heart of lead. Your own, <author>Oscar</author></letter>
