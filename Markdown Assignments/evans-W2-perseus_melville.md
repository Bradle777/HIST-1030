# Perseus Digital Library Reponse Paper

One the site's home page, there is a very long alphabetical list of Greek and Roman authors with a search bar at the top. The database
is quite in depth with subheadings under each author for all the works they published. As a someone who is not familiar with ancient 
literature and history, I would not know even where to begin on this site. It definitely appears to be a site for professionals and 
researchers who know exactly what they are searching for, not for someone who just wants to browse for texts.

Something I really appreciate about the site is that the different ways of ordering the library are all beneficial in their own ways.
+ Text Group: This organization alphabetically sorts by the authors name, which is helpful for someone who wants to find all the works by one specific author.
+  CTS URN: This method numerically sorts the texts based on the CTS URN, which is helpful for someone who was only given a CTS URN. It sorted the authors into greek, latin, persian, ancient jewish, english, and farsi literature, helpful for someone looking at a specific language group.
+  Work: This sorting method displays every work all alphabetically, with no sub-organization. This helps those who might be less certain of what they are looking for and can skim until they see a title that they recognize or like, as well as those who might not know the authors name or the exact title.
  
Once you select a text you want[^1], several readability modifications are offered like text size and text width. Their are export functions as a text, xml, and to a git repository, which is very effective support for digital humanities researchers.
It also has a morphology feature that analyzes the word you highlight and a text search feature for very long texts. 
The read features support linguistics, etymology, and history research, and pretty much anything one can relate to greek texts.
