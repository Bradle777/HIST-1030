# TEI Chapter 14

This chapter talks about the encoding of names, dates, people, and places in a manner that is 
much more detailed than is otherwise talked about in the various other chapters about TEI documents. For example in the other
more generic core module, one can identify a specifc text line as a proper noun, (a referring string) and then provide an 
attribute value for type. This modules elements allow one to be much more specific and lay out a structure to explicitly
differentiate between this information. 

This is meant to be used in a biographical, historical, and geographical sense where the encoded text will be integrated into data systems.

For some specifics the att.naming class of attributes are specialized to support the linking of the name element with the thing (person, place, orgnization, etc.)
The att.datatable class of attributes allow for the normalizing of the date or time encoded.
The att.personal class of attributes is meant for the components of names, surname, honorary title, suffix, etc., each which provide
different but essential information about a person, represented in their name.

This chapter provides very handy information about the usage of different elements in relation to proper nouns, which relates to our project
because the identity of each person is very important in their role and depiction as a part of society. I think some of this TEI from 14.2 can be adapted in 
our chara elements like the element <surname> with respect to the various family dynamics of the Andronicus's, or the families in Much Ado, or the marriages in As You Like It.
Further additions mentioning whether the surname is married or birth related would be very helpful in representing female autonomy.
