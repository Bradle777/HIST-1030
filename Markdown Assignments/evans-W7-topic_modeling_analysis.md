# Mining the Dispatch Analysis

*Topic modeling is a tool that operates on plain text to provide descriptive statistical information. How might it play a role in your project?*

What topic modeling is?
How they used it.
How I can use it.

Topic modeling is a statistical method of going over a vast corpus of texts by distant reading
as opposed to close up reading on a document-by-document basis. The way topic-modeling works 
is it finds a group of words, called a topic, that often appear together. 

Applying this to a large quantity of documents results in many topics that apply to varying degrees in all the documents.
The program does not name what the topic, group of words, is referencing. That is the job of
the researcher, determining what the topic is in context of the corpus. When the topics are created
by the algorithm, each document is identified by the percentage of which the topic is present. 
This allows the researcher to filter texts by inclusion or exclusion of certain topics. In the 
context of my group project, if I put each scene of all 4 plays as a seperate document, I could
find scenes that included at least 50% of mentions of love/marriage, or color, or depictions as villains.
It does not replace close-reading, but it allows the detection of patterns in the full archive. 

A method of analysis via patterns that could be applied to my project is comparing references of love vs 
references of villainy. If I set a topic model where scenes were individual documents, I could create a
graph that showed the percentage of the love topic per scene overlayed by a graph that showed the 
percentage of the violence topic per scene and identify if they go hand in hand, are opposites, or have no
correlation.
