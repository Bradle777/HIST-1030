# The TEI Header

*How will you handle metadata (what type of information, how will be it be encoded or represented) in your project?*

The TEI Header is a part of every file and has five parts. The file description (fileDesc),
text profile (encodingDesc), profile description (profileDesc) , a container element (xenoData) , and revision history (revisionDesc).

The file description contains bibliographic and cataloguing information, as well as the sources from which the document came from.
For my group's project, this information is not incredibly necessary because it will not likely be published and since not many 
will be viewing it, citing it, or storing it, it is of less importance. However, it is a required element, so we will include it.

The encoding description  includes information on how the text was changed when it was transcribed 
and information on the levels of analysis of the document. This information would be very important for my group's project,
because when focusing on language, transcription changes matter, and our methods will need detailed explaination, as in any 
proper research project.

The profile description contains information about the context from which the work was produced and any information on language types,
dialects, calendar types, etc. This rudimentary information is necessary for context of our play's. But they are in english, though an older dialect,
and should not require immense vocabulary description.

The container element allows for non-TEI metadata markup, which I am not yet sure how we may or may not use that as a group,
but we will definitely discuss it later on its role in our research.

Finally the revision description contains a summary the revision versions of the document. This is very important
organizationally to keep track of changes in case you want to undo or backtrack to past ideas and is important
when working as a group to track who made which edits, so we will definitely use it.
