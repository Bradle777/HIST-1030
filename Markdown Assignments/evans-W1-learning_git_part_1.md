# Learning Git Part 1: Response Paper

The command line is  a direct input from the user of the device  to 
the  computer's software. It is different than my past methods of 
interacting with my files because I am creating the commands instead 
of picking commands from a series of options. There is also not a visual 
component in the command line as opposed to the more graphical methods 
used by the majority.

In my previous version control systems (VCS) each specific change was 
stored with a time stamp for that file, where as Git records what 
all my files look like in a "snapshot" with a time stamp after every 
time I commit a change. Furthermore, Git allows for offline work while 
my other VCS's had restrictions. You can access your 
project and commit changes all on your local copy, no matter your 
connection. There is no central server that I have to be connected to. 
Git is similar to my other VCS's in that it tracks all data and changes,
and makes erasure near impossible, perhaps to higher degree than my 
other systems.
