 **Comparing Different Genres of African-American Music Lyrics**
 
 Slave Spiritual Songs are the root for a lot of African-American music evolution, from the Underground Railroad to Reconstruction to Jim Crow 
 to the Civil Rights Movement of the fifties and sixties and beyond. And while the music changes, new sounds, artists, and emotions, key similarities and differences are bound to be present.
 Markup would focus on theme words, signs of emotion (hopeful, pessimistic, jubilation,etc.), and references to current events of the time. 
 Contextualizing each song with the year it is published would also be important for final conclusions to view the change of language.

 Most of this music is in the public domain because the original lyrics were published before 1926. Music written before 1989 was subject to varying formalities regarding copyrright which 
 may prevent some songs from being used, but it's not something that can't be worked around.
