# Project Proposal
## Comparing Modern Constitutions of Native American Tribes

### Texts

All Native-American Nation's constitutions are in the public domain and this site called [Native American Constitutions](https://thorpe.law.ou.edu/const.html)
has files of dozens of Constitutions that are free and easy to view. 
Specific Constitutions that caught my eye for this project were as follows.
   + [Little River Band of Indians of Manistee, Michigan](https://thorpe.law.ou.edu/constitution/ottawa2.html)
    + [Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe](https://thorpe.law.ou.edu/constitution/stregisconst.html)
    + [Native Tribe of Huslia](https://thorpe.law.ou.edu/constitution/huslia/index.html)
    + [Yavapai Apache Nation](https://thorpe.law.ou.edu/constitution/Yavapai/YAconst.html#preamble)
    + [Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah)](https://thorpe.law.ou.edu/constitution/wampanoag/index.html)
    + [Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma](https://thorpe.law.ou.edu/constitution/eastshawcons.html)
    + [Ely Shoshone Tribe](https://thorpe.law.ou.edu/constitution/shoshone/sh-const.html)
    + [Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians](https://thorpe.law.ou.edu/constitution/GTBcons3.html)
    + [Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas](https://thorpe.law.ou.edu/constitution/kickapoo/index.html)
 
 When choosing constitutions for the project it will also be important to pick tribes and nations
 that are scattered across the United States to ensure each environmental region is accounted for because 
 the environment greatly affected ancient tribal traditions and lifestyles, which would be reflected in their constitution.
 
 ### Research Questions
 The purpose of this research would be to identify similar themes across  Native American tribes.
 All these nations are so unique and diverse, so identifying similarities in their constitutions
  will tie together core beliefs across groups of different cultures and traditions.
  Furthermore, this research can quantitatively measure the level of democracy each of these constitutions ensure, using a comparison to the United States of America constitution as a benchmark.
  
  
  ### Approach and Methods
  To answer these research questions, markup of these constitutions will have to be delineated with definitions of themes, for uniform and helpful markup.
  References to nationalism, religion (distinguish between Christianity and creation myth/spirituality), freedom to ____, property, elections, sovereignty, and more to be determined by the group.
  References to a unitary executive or non-unitary executive, as well as the organization of its judiciary system and popular election are effective markups for measuring democracy.
   
  
  The constitutions are large documents so the focus of markup would be on the preamble, the article addressing Civil Rights, powers of the government, and membership.
  These are chosen due to their importance in establishing a set of laws and valued beliefs of a group of people.
