# The Rossetti Archive Website

This website provides access to the exstensive works of Dante Gabriel Rossetti,
which includes art and texts that mainly he, but also some of his contemporaries created.
Purely as a site designed to provide free access to a vast quantity of resources,
it achieves its goal. It includes different heading/genres of his work for better classification,
as well as a general search engine designed for any means of search and filtering of options.
Criteria options that the search engine provides is very in depth allowing specificity in time period,
genre, title, key words or phrases, and even a boolean search (using keywords AND, OR, NOT).

Moving onto viewer accesbility, I appreciate the various tabs explaining the website, how it was compiled, and the various exhibits and 
collections it contains from a user standpoint.  However, the search engine is quite out-dated. The display is not well-made and reminds 
me of old public library computer searches. It gets the job done, with many search results, and comprehensive information about the source, the
formatting of the page is just a little off. 

Overall, for a professional researcher who knows what they are looking for, this site
is an excellent resource and could provide everything a person could want about the works
of Dante Rossetti.
